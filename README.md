# Imaging-for-Neuroscience
Imaging for Neuroscience final project

# Goal
The goal of this homework is to investigate the relationship between resting state functional MRI
and diffusion MRI data. 
The work is divided in three parts:
- Resting state fMRI analysis;
- Diffusion MRI analysis;
- DMRI/fMRI integration.

In this repository the Matlab script developed for the processing and analysis of the data is uploaded, but not the dataset itself.
Part of the analysis is conducted using the [SPM12 software](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/).

**For the detailed description of the project, the report is availabe in pdf format**
